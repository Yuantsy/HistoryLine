# Human's Understanding and Usage of Electricity

## Discovering Electricity

Electricity has been a subject of fascination since ancient times. The Greeks discovered static electricity by rubbing amber against animal fur, which attracted lightweight objects. This phenomenon is attributed to the triboelectric effect.

## Pioneering Experiments in Electricity

In the 17th and 18th centuries, various experiments were conducted to understand the nature of electricity:

### Benjamin Franklin

Benjamin Franklin's famous kite experiment in 1752 demonstrated that lightning is a form of electricity. He also coined the terms "positive" and "negative" to describe electrical charges.

### Luigi Galvani

Luigi Galvani's experiments with frog legs in the 1780s revealed the relationship between electricity and the nervous system, leading to the discovery of bioelectricity.

### Alessandro Volta

Alessandro Volta invented the first true battery, the Voltaic Pile, in 1800. This device provided a steady source of electrical current and allowed for further experimentation with electricity.

## Electromagnetism and the Birth of Electrical Engineering

The understanding of electricity took a giant leap forward with the discovery of electromagnetism:

### Hans Christian Ørsted

In 1820, Hans Christian Ørsted discovered that electric currents create magnetic fields, establishing a connection between electricity and magnetism.

### Michael Faraday

Michael Faraday's work on electromagnetic induction in the 1830s demonstrated that a changing magnetic field can generate an electric current. Faraday's discoveries laid the foundation for the development of electric generators and transformers.

### James Clerk Maxwell

James Clerk Maxwell's equations, formulated in the 1860s, unified the theories of electricity and magnetism, providing a comprehensive mathematical framework for the understanding of electromagnetic fields.

## Harnessing Electricity

The latter half of the 19th century saw rapid advancements in the generation, transmission, and utilization of electricity:

### Thomas Edison

Thomas Edison's invention of the incandescent light bulb in 1879 marked a turning point in the practical application of electricity. Edison also developed the first commercial power distribution system using direct current (DC).

### Nikola Tesla

Nikola Tesla's work on alternating current (AC) in the late 19th century revolutionized the transmission of electrical power over long distances. Tesla's inventions, such as the induction motor and the Tesla Coil, significantly advanced the field of electrical engineering.

### George Westinghouse

George Westinghouse's development of the AC power distribution system and his collaboration with Tesla led to the widespread adoption of AC power, which remains the global standard for electricity transmission today.

The understanding and usage of electricity have evolved dramatically over the centuries, leading to the development of the electrical engineering discipline and transforming our daily lives.


The Development of Computer Science from Electrical Engineering
From Analog to Digital Electronics
As electrical engineering progressed, the focus shifted from analog electronics, which relied on continuously variable signals, to digital electronics that used discrete values. Digital electronics provided the foundation for the development of modern computer science.

Binary Logic and Boolean Algebra
In the 19th century, George Boole formulated Boolean algebra, a mathematical framework for analyzing and simplifying logical expressions. Claude Shannon later applied Boolean algebra to electronic circuits, enabling the development of digital logic and binary systems used in modern computing.

Electronic Components for Computing
In the early 20th century, the invention of vacuum tubes and later transistors paved the way for the development of electronic devices capable of performing complex calculations. These components served as the building blocks for early computers and digital systems.

Vacuum Tubes
Vacuum tubes were the first electronic devices capable of amplifying signals and switching between states, making them essential components in early electronic computers such as the ENIAC and the Colossus.

Transistors
The invention of the transistor in 1947 revolutionized the electronics industry, allowing for the miniaturization of electronic devices and leading to the development of integrated circuits. Transistors provided a more reliable and energy-efficient alternative to vacuum tubes in computing applications.

Integrated Circuits
Integrated circuits, or microchips, enabled the further miniaturization of electronic components and allowed for the creation of increasingly complex and powerful digital systems. Integrated circuits also made it possible to develop microprocessors, which serve as the brains of modern computers.

Early Computers and Programming Languages
The development of early computers, such as the ENIAC, the Manchester Mark 1, and the IBM 701, marked the beginning of the computer age. These machines required new methods for programming and processing data, leading to the creation of programming languages and the field of computer science.

Assembly Language
Assembly language was the first step towards higher-level programming languages. It allowed programmers to use human-readable mnemonics instead of machine code, making programming more accessible and efficient.

High-Level Programming Languages
High-level programming languages, such as FORTRAN, COBOL, and Lisp, emerged in the 1950s and 1960s. These languages provided a more abstract and human-friendly way of programming, enabling programmers to focus on problem-solving instead of low-level hardware details.

The Evolution of Computer Science
As computer systems became more complex and powerful, the field of computer science expanded to encompass various sub-disciplines, including:

Algorithms and data structures
Computer architecture and organization
Operating systems
Networking and communication
Databases and information retrieval
Artificial intelligence and machine learning
Human-computer interaction
Software engineering
The development of computer science from electrical engineering has revolutionized the world, transforming how we live, work, and communicate. Today, computer science continues to evolve, driven by advancements in hardware, software, and our ever-growing understanding of the potential applications of computing technology.
